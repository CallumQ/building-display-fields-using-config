This is just a quick and dirty proof of concept of whether or not it is feasible to build UI components based on a config block. At the current stage all it does is populates the placeholder of a textbox, but it proves that it is at least feasible. Further work would be required to encompass a wider range of componets(date pickers, dropdowns,checkboxes,etc..). the test objects that I am using are stored in the `db.json`

I have chosen to use react-semantic-ui to start with, as the validation done against forms is also config based.
